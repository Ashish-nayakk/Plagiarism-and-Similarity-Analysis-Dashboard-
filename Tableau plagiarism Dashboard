Plagiarism and Similarity Analysis Dashboard
Project Overview
This repository contains a data visualization dashboard designed to detect and analyze document similarity across a collection of technical files. Using advanced similarity scoring algorithms, the dashboard provides an intuitive interface for identifying potential plagiarism, document duplicates, and "high-risk" content overlaps.

The primary goal is to transform raw similarity matrices into actionable insights for academic or professional integrity reviews.

Key Features
Similarity Score Matrix: A heatmap visualization identifying clusters of high-overlap between file pairs.

High-Similarity Breakdown: A stacked bar chart highlighting specific documents that exceed threshold limits, including 1:1 duplicates.

Risk Distribution Profiling: A high-level executive summary (Pie Chart) categorizing comparisons into "High Risk" (32.9%) vs. "Low Risk" (67.1%).

Granular Pairwise Analysis: A bubble chart matrix providing exact percentage matches and color-coded risk flags for deep-dive investigation.

Technical Stack
Data Processing: Python (Pandas, NumPy)

Similarity Logic: [Insert Method, e.g., TF-IDF, Cosine Similarity, or Jaccard Index]

Visualization: [Insert Tool, e.g., Tableau, Power BI, or Plotly/Dash]

File Formats Supported: PDF, TXT, and DOCX

Dashboard Insights
Based on the current dataset analysis:

Total Comparisons: 140 pairs.

Critical Findings: 46 cases (32.9%) flagged for manual review due to high similarity scores.

Key Outliers: KNN.pdf and svm_merged.pdf show the highest degree of structural overlap with other documents in the repository.
